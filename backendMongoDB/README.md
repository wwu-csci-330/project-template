You will need to install a global dependency by running:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

To start the server, you need to:

1. create a MongoDB Atlas account
2. set up a MongoDB database
3. find the connection string and use it to replace the variable in the .env file (e.g., ATLAS_URI); please note that you may need to replace username/password in the copied string with real username/password
4. start the server by running "npm start"
